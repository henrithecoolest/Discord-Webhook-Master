# Discord Webhooks - In Python

Simple webhook program running in the console.

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install the required packages using the command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Input the Webhook-URL ([See documentation here](https://discord.com/developers/docs/resources/webhook)) and you're good to go! I hope you enjoy this little program I made in oder to learn python (and it won't be my last Python project)!
